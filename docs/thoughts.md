Pitfalls in uncoordinated backlink identity (i.e. when users can't set the rel=me): 

Other user content on profile pages:

- github sponsor gets a link on another users profile page, making them look like the same user


Mutual Fan

- Profile (dev.to) links to someone else (big fan, love your stuff!)

- Other person links back to first (I love my fans, here is my link to their page)


The very concept of a profile page
- anything can be a profile page, some pages make better profile pages than others, some happen to be used like profile pages
- headers make everything look like a profile page

- canonicalization problems


Best profile sites often have the worst blockers on crawlers


No rel=me
- checkers have to crawl EVERYTHING because any link could be a rel=me surrogate

Signatures on a link means PGP hell again, with no way to trust a cert
